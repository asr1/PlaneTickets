# PlaneTickets
A python script that crawls Expedia for cheap fuzzy flights.

# Prerequisites
Firefox

#Usage
This tool allows you to be notified for cheap, vague tickets. For example, you can use WanderLust to say "I'd like to fly from either Cedar Rapids or Chicago to either Boston or Seattle for roughly 8 days in the month of July for under $600." and let WanderLust run in the background. It will email you if it finds tickets matching this description.

The GUI should be pretty straightforward to use.

#Stretch Goals:
autocomplete dictionary for airport codes

	Use a lookup table, and actually map city->code?
	
Log last settings and reload on open

prettier date formatting (01-May-2017 would be ideal)

Find a way to reuse all of those nearly identical functions


Pull requests welcome.
